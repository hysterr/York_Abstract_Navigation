	- Simulation.Select_Path()
		- Called separately for agent and human 
		- Allows one entities path to be changed/inspected without impacting the other. 

	- Simulation.Step() 
		- Changed to Simulation.Step_Agent() for the agent 
			- Takes map input as conditional to allow heated_map probabilities
			- Varies the uniform probability value based on summated probilities
			- Does not interact with the human class, that will be applied in the main script
		- Currently not inplemented for the human

	- Environment.Update_Heat()
		- Bug fix for scaling issue which only worked for 0.5 scale factors. 
		- Adjusted how the method applies heat to connections.
			- Previously, only one constant was required, now two have been applied
				- Scale1 variable applied to both connections
				- Scale2 variable applied to single connection
		- Risk factor reduces the "Success" rate and is now split across the "Return" and "Fail" states
			- 2/3 applied to "Return"
			- 1/3 applied to "Fail"

	- Coop_Task.py 
		- Simulation procedure has been adjusted to account for the changes described above:
			1. perform current phase identification
			2. assign human tasks 
			3. perform path finding for human 
			4. update heat for agent path 
			5. perform path finding for agent
			6. discrete step for agent (no step for human yet...)
